## Objective

Research and implement several headless CMS systems to determine the best fit for your project. This task involves:
- Researching five popular headless CMS options.
- Implementing and experimenting with each CMS on separate copies of your website.
- Providing proof of your work through screenshots, code samples, or a video.
- Submitting your findings in markdown format or using your chosen template engine.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Research Headless CMS Options
Start by researching five headless CMS platforms. Some popular options include:
  - **Strapi**
  - **Contentful**
  - **Sanity**
  - **Prismic**
  - **Ghost**

You are not limited to these options, so feel free to explore others if you find something that better suits your project requirements. Write a brief overview of each CMS, including:
- Key features
- Strengths and limitations
- Typical use cases
- Pricing structure (if applicable)

### Select One CMS to Use
After evaluating each option, select the CMS that best meets your project needs and goals.

### Implement and Experiment with Each CMS
To get hands-on experience, create a few copies of your website and integrate each CMS separately. As you work with each CMS:
- Observe how it impacts your workflow.
- Take note of setup complexity, ease of use, and compatibility with your project’s requirements.
- Experiment with content management and deployment to get a feel for the CMS’s capabilities.

### Provide Proof of Work
Document your experimentation through one or more of the following:
  - **Screenshots**: Capture key points in your integration process.
  - **Code Samples**: Include any code that demonstrates how you integrated each CMS.
  - **Video**: Create a short walkthrough of your setup and integration experience.
  
This proof of work will help showcase your ability to evaluate and implement new technologies, an essential skill for future projects and employers.

### Submission Guidelines
Embed your final write-up and proof of work within your ongoing project. Use markdown (or your chosen template engine) to format your findings and reflections. Ensure the submission is accessible by:
- Adding a link to your CMS exploration in the project header, or
- Placing it in an obvious spot on the main page for easy access.

## Deliverables
Your submission should include:
- A written overview of each CMS you researched.
- A brief explanation of the CMS you chose for your project and why.
- Proof of work demonstrating your experimentation with each CMS.
- A clear link to your submission embedded within your project.
