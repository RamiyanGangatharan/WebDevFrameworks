## Unit 1: Static Site Generation and Markdown
---
#### Pre-Built Markup
---
##### Static Site Generation and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- 11ty is a static site generation framework that converts a few files into many during build time.
- Static sites are typically served by CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).
  - **Advantage**: CDNs cache static sites, whereas dynamic sites can't be cached as effectively due to constant data requests.

##### Content Management System (CMS)
- Markup can be stored in a CMS.
- A CMS renders a websiteâ€™s content at runtime without modifying any code.
  - **Use Case**: A CMS allows non-developers to modify and rebuild the site using a GUI.
  - **Headless CMS**: In this course, we use a headless CMS, which manages content only, while traditional CMSs manage both the front and back ends.

##### Security
- Static sites pose minimal security risks since they don't involve server-side processing or databases.
  - **Common Threats**: Websites are often vulnerable to SQL injection or script-based attacks, but static sites mitigate these risks.

##### Decoupling
- Decoupling refers to separating the front end and back end so teams can work on them independently.
  - **Example**: Microservices are decoupled, meaning they don't depend on one another directly, allowing for simultaneous updates without downtime. Monolithic applications, by contrast, may require downtime for maintenance.

##### Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Accessibility
- Search engines and accessibility tools struggle with understanding dynamically generated pages. This is why static pages are preferred.
