                                Hello! I'm Ramiyan Gangatharan, a third-year student in the Computer Programming and
                                Analysis program at Durham College. This site is part of a project for my Web Development 
                                Frameworks course, designed to showcase the skills and knowledge I've developed through my 
                                studies. Before enrolling at Durham College, I briefly pursued Software Engineering Technology 
                                at Centennial College. However, I chose to focus on a path that better aligned with my goals. 
                                My technical expertise spans various programming languages and frameworks, which Iâ€™ve applied 
                                across a range of projects. You can view some of my work on <a href="https://rami-zeta.vercel.app/" 
                                target="_blank">my portfolio site</a>, including projects like MERN stack-based applications, 
                                .NET (C#), Java with JSP & Tomcat, and Python with API integration. I also spent time focusing 
                                on algorithms, data structures, and graph theory during breaks, which enhanced my problem-solving 
                                capabilities. In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained valuable experience as a Shift Supervisor 
                                at Tim Hortons from May 2023 to July 2024. I started as Counter Staff in November 2021 and worked my 
                                way up to Shift Supervisor, where I learned about team leadership, customer service, and operations 
                                management. While challenging, this role helped me developstrong social and leadership skills.
