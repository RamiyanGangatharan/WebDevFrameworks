### What is Artificial Intelligence?

According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence), *"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy. Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects, understand and respond to human language, learn from new information and experience, and make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can also act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention, such as in the case of self-driving cars. However, in 2024, most AI researchers and practitioners—along with the majority of AI-related headlines—are focused on breakthroughs in generative AI (gen AI), a technology capable of creating original text, images, video, and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it’s important to first grasp the underlying technologies: machine learning (ML) and deep learning."*

### Appropriate Usages of Artificial Intelligence

In academic environments, the use of AI is often regulated by school policies. While some professors may permit AI for specific activities or experiments, it's essential to recognize its limitations. Personally, I use AI primarily to troubleshoot coding issues that I cannot resolve through traditional resources like Stack Overflow, Reddit, or official documentation, such as Microsoft's .NET Framework or the IBM Z/OS manual for mainframe concerns. Throughout my three years at Durham College, I've found that AI can be a valuable educational tool. However, it should not be abused; some students rely too heavily on it, which hampers their understanding of core software development concepts.

AI usage is context-dependent. For example, while some individuals may request AI to build entire applications, this approach can lead to errors. A more effective strategy is to develop the application independently while consulting AI for specific questions when traditional resources fall short. For instance, when I was creating this website, I encountered an issue with JSON referencing; ChatGPT guided me to correct an incorrect alias in the front matter of my page. AI can be particularly beneficial in Rapid Application Development (RAD) scenarios where a basic application is needed. It is also useful for generating repetitive code, allowing you to implement the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. For example, you can ask AI to create HTML boilerplates if you’re not using any templates. Additionally, AI can help clarify application requirements when technical jargon in documentation is challenging to understand or when you need explanations of specific components.
