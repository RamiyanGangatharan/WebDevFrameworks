According to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-machine-learning/), "*Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets, allowing them to make predictions on new, similar data without explicit programming for each task. Traditional machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict outputs, yielding actionable insights. This technology finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.
For instance, recommender systems use historical data to personalize suggestions. Netflix, for example, employs collaborative and content-based filtering to recommend movies and TV shows based on user viewing history, ratings, and genre preferences. Reinforcement learning further enhances these systems by enabling agents to make decisions based on environmental feedback, continually refining recommendations.
Machine learningâ€™s impact extends to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, enhancing their adaptability in dynamic environments. This approach marks a breakthrough where machines learn from data examples to generate accurate outcomes, closely intertwined with data mining and data science.*"
