# Graph Theory

Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (also called nodes or points) and edges (also called arcs or lines) that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs can be directed (where edges have a direction) or undirected (where edges have no direction), and they can be weighted or unweighted, depending on whether a numerical value (or weight) is assigned to each edge.

Graphs are fundamental in computer science (CS) because they are used to represent a wide variety of structures and systems. Examples include social networks, transportation systems, the internet, and dependency graphs in software. In each of these cases, vertices represent entities, and edges represent relationships or interactions between them.

#### Key Concepts in Graph Theory:

- Vertices (Nodes): These represent the objects in a graph.
- Edges (Links): These represent the relationships between the objects.
- Adjacency: The relationship between two vertices connected by an edge.
- Degree of a Vertex: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
- Paths and Cycles: A path is a sequence of edges connecting vertices, and a cycle is a path where the first and last vertices are the same.
- Connected Graph: A graph where there is a path between any pair of vertices.
- Subgraph: A subset of a graph's vertices and edges that form a graph.
