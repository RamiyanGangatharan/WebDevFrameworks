                            Hello! I'm Ramiyan Gangatharan, a third-year student in the Computer Programming and
                            Analysis program at Durham College.
                            This site is part of a project for my Web Development Frameworks course, designed to
                            showcase the skills and knowledge I've
                            developed through my studies. Before enrolling at Durham College, I briefly pursued Software
                            Engineering Technology at Centennial College.
                            However, I chose to focus on a path that better aligned with my goals. My technical
                            expertise spans various programming languages and frameworks,
                            which Iâ€™ve applied across a range of projects. You can view some of my work on <a
                                    href="https://rami-zeta.vercel.app/" target="_blank">my portfolio site</a>,
                            including projects like MERN stack-based applications, .NET (C#), Java with JSP & Tomcat,
                            and Python with API integration.
                            I also spent time focusing on algorithms, data structures, and graph theory during breaks,
                            which enhanced my problem-solving capabilities.
                            In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained valuable experience as a Shift Supervisor at
                            Tim Hortons from May 2023 to July 2024.
                            I started as Counter Staff in November 2021 and worked my way up to Shift Supervisor, where
                            I learned about team leadership,
                            customer service, and operations management. While challenging, this role helped me develop
                            strong social and leadership skills.
